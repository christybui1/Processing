Game is called Asteroid Attack
It is a 10 second shooting game consisting three classes: a player, meteors, and bullets
100 Meteors fall from the top of the screen 
The player (located at bottom of screen) can continiously fire bullets and move left and right 
The player has 10 seconds to shoot atleast 50 meteors to save Planet Earth
Failure to shoot atleast 50 meteors results in game lost 

To run the game:

Spacebar: Shoot bullets
Arduino joystick: move left and right. Had issues so player has to use 
"A" and "D" key to move left and right
